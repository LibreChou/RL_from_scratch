# Reinforcement learning
- This is where I write various RL algorithms in python.
- Will keep updating as I keep learning more.
- Will try to document as well as I can

Currently my only source for learning is "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction book  by Andrew Barto and Richard S. Sutton"

# Progress
- random walk from Sutton and Barto's book
- Model dependent
  - Value iteration
  - Policy iteration
- Model independent
  - Q-learning (TD0)
  - SARSA (TD0)
  - Expected SARSA (TD0)
  - TD-lambda methods
  - k-step SARSA


# TODO
- Gauss-Seidel Value iteration
- Asynchronous Value iteration
- More from [here](http://www.professeurs.polymtl.ca/jerome.le-ny/teaching/DP_fall09/notes/lec10_VI_PI.pdf)
